    <h2>Matthew Parker and his Library</h2>
    <p>For the first sixteen years of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, Matthew Parker served as Archbishop of Canterbury. Archbishop Parker was born in 1504 in Norwich, and entered Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in the early 1520s. During his time at Cambridge, Parker became close friends with Thomas Bilney, a leader of the early reformers at Cambridge. His friendship with Bilney and other reformers did not persuade him at that time to radical Protestantism, but they did shape the nature of his studies in years to come:</p>
    <blockquote>&hellip; he was certainly so devoted to Bilney as to journey to Norwich to be present at his martyrdom in 1531. On the other hand, he does not seem to have drawn on himself the hostile attention of the conservatives. Perhaps this was partly because he was still engaged in his theological studies and had not yet begun to preach, partly because he did not indulge in the oddities of Bilney or the indiscretions of Barnes. But his friendship was firmly with the critics of the contemporary Roman Church and it no doubt added interest and practical point to his study of the Councils and the Fathers which was to lay a solid foundation for his later approach to the problems he had to face as Archbishop.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></blockquote>
    <p>In these early years, while Parker was certainly not a radical reformer, he was beginning to develop his historically-minded view of theology.</p>
    <p>Later in his Cambridge years, Parker was a popular preacher. He came to the attention of Queen Anne Boleyn and was appointed one of her chaplains in 1535. Not much is known about his activities during his service to the queen, but just before her arrest she charged him with the spiritual care of her daughter Elizabeth, a duty he took quite seriously through the rest of his life.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> By Queen Anne&rsquo;s nomination, Parker was appointed Dean of the College of Stoke-by-Clare also in 1535. After Queen Anne&rsquo;s death, Henry VIII nominated Parker for Mastership of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and appointed Parker as one of his own chaplains, an office which he kept until the king&rsquo;s death in 1547.</p>
    <p>During Edward VI&rsquo;s rule, Parker lost his position as Dean of Stoke-by-Clare. He was married on 24 June 1547 to a woman named Margaret Harleston. The two met seven years before but were unable to marry while Henry VIII maintained law prescribing clerical celibacy.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> Together they had four sons, with two surviving to adulthood: John (b. 1548) and Matthew (b. 1551)<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>. He continued to preach under Edward, but his primary work was still in Cambridge, where he was elected Vice-Chancellor. This was the work he loved best, and would say later during his later work as Archbishop that he would like to go back to the Mastership of Corpus.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
    <p>Upon Edward&rsquo;s death and the coronation of Mary I, Parker was &ldquo;allowed to resign&rdquo; from Corpus and was stripped of his other offices, likely with his marriage as the reason.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> He did not come under significant threat in the face of Mary&rsquo;s burning of Protestants, however:</p>
    <blockquote>It was a sign of his importance in Cambridge that Northumberland, on his way through the town on July 15 to attempt to overthrow Queen Mary, should have invited him&hellip; to supper. His advice and support were evidently valuable. But neither that incident nor his previous dependence on Anne Boleyn seems to have marked him out subsequently for serious or determined persecution by the authorities under Mary. On one occasion, it is true, he was nearly taken. &lsquo;Flying in a night, from such as sought for me to my peril, I fell off my horse so dangerously that I shall never recover it.&rsquo; But that seems to have been the only time he was in personal danger.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></blockquote>
    <p>For the remainder of Mary&rsquo;s reign, Parker lived with his wife and children in the house of a friend. During this period, not having his previous positions to fill his time, Parker completed both a metrical translation of the psalter into English (printed by John Day, probably in 1567) and a defense of clerical marriage (which printed anonymously by Day, also likely in 1567) based on the work of John Ponet, former bishop of Winchester.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
    <p>Having avoided exile and death for the six years of Mary I&rsquo;s reign, Parker was summoned to London by Queen Elizabeth I&rsquo;s secretary Sir William Cecil. Knowing what this signified, Parker replied saying he was not fit for the role of archbishop and did not want to fail to live up to expectations. Following two more letters requesting his presence, Parker complied and was elevated to Archbishop of Canterbury in 1559.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
    <p>Parker was instrumental in the religious settlement that occurred under Elizabeth. Notably, he led the convocation in 1563 responsible for creating the Thirty-nine Articles. Parker of course did a great number of other important things as Archbishop, and it would be toilsome to enumerate them here, but among them are his involvement with the production of <em>An Homelie against Disoedience and Wylfull Rebellion</em> and ensuring the publication of Heinrich Bullinger&rsquo;s attack of the papal bull which declared Elizabeth a heretic.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> Parker served as archbishop until his death in 1575.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In addition to his work on the reforms made under Queen Elizabeth, Parker was a prolific collector of medieval manuscripts and printed books. He began collecting printed books during his undergraduate studies at Cambridge, mostly the works of protestant writers of his day and major editions of the Church Fathers, but showed little interest in collecting manuscripts on a large scale until after he became archbishop. A letter written to Parker by John Bale in 1560 indicates that Parker was inquiring as to the owners of medieval texts&mdash; printed and manuscript&mdash; on behalf of the queen. Elizabeth had been contacted by Matthias Flacius Illyricus, a protestant historian in the process of writing an ecclesiastical history and wishing to see any English works that might be useful to him.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> The letter from Bale was, according to manuscript scholar Timothy Graham:</p>
    <blockquote>&hellip;if not a symptom that Parker was already attempting to locate manuscripts on his own account at this early stage of his archiepiscopate, nevertheless seems to have had an important impact on Parker&rsquo;s activity as a manuscript collector. It surely helped to alert him to the need to seek actively for manuscripts before they were lost forever.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></blockquote>
    <p>Many of the manuscripts from Bale&rsquo;s list eventually ended up in Parker&rsquo;s collection.</p>
    <p>Letters from various bishops to Parker during the mid-1560s indicate that he was actively seeking books from across England during that decade, with only moderate success. The bishops reported already having found all such books, or finding only a few that would be of interest. Some time before 1567, Parker&rsquo;s secretary John Jocelyn made a list of surviving medieval texts and who owned copies. This list, like Bale&rsquo;s letter, served as an &ldquo;acquisitions guide&rdquo; of sorts for Parker.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a> With this list, Parker was able to acquire materials more systematically.</p>
    <p>In July of 1568, Parker wrote to Sir William Cecil, chief advisor to the queen, asking for assistance in gaining access to privately owned books he had not yet been able to access. A broadsheet issued later that month by the Privy Council granted Parker that power, stating that owners of &ldquo;auncient records or monuments&rdquo; were &ldquo;on the receipt of a summons from the Archbishop of Canterbury, to &lsquo;gently impart the same&rsquo; to him&rdquo; (Page, 43-4). This greatly increased Parker&rsquo;s collecting capacity. This order stated that after inspection, materials would be returned to their owners with the understanding that if ever they were needed again for reference, they could be retrieved again. It seems it was not frequently the case that manuscripts were returned&mdash;hundreds of books stayed in Parker&rsquo;s collection&mdash;but the existence of &ldquo;several manuscripts now in the British Library that contain Parkerian markings but for which there is no evidence of actual Parkerian ownership&rdquo; suggests that he did not keep every manuscript he studied (Graham, 327).</p>
    <h3><a name="_Toc481975738"></a>Parker&rsquo;s Library</h3>
    <p>Beginning in 1574, Parker gave most of his collection to Cambridge University. His manuscripts were given to Corpus Christi College with the understanding that the masters of Gonville and Caius College and Trinity Hall would annually check the contents of the library against copies of the register they had been given and that custody of the collection would rotate among those three colleges if any negligence was found.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> Other books, especially printed volumes, were given to various other libraries at the university, including the Cambridge University Library. Still today, most of his collection resides in the care of The Parker Library at Corpus Christi College. The library&rsquo;s holdings include the earliest copy of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (c. 890), Matthew Paris&rsquo;s <em>Chronica maiora </em>(c. 1230-50), and the beautifully illuminated Bury and Dover Bibles (c. 1135 and 1150). This collection accounts for a large portion of all surviving manuscripts in Old English.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
    <p>Despite his great reverence for the content of his manuscripts, Parker&rsquo;s books were not treated well, going by modern curatorial standards. Most of his manuscripts were rebound, and often unrelated texts were bound into a single volume because they were of a similar size. Parker did not like manuscripts to seem incomplete, he liked a book to open and close neatly.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a> There were several ways he dealt with missing content. When he had another copy of the same text, Parker had scribes imitating the original hand insert the missing text. When there was no other copy of the text from which to copy, Parker removed the offending pieces of text:</p>
    <blockquote>His Canterbury pontiﬁcal, for example, lacked leaves at the beginning as well as the end. Its ﬁrst surviving leaf has the concluding lines of an Old English text found in no other manuscript. Unable to supply the missing text, and objecting to the untidiness of having his manuscript begin with an acephalous fragment, Parker had the entire ﬁrst page erased, turning it into an endleaf on which he then entered his signature of ownership.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></blockquote>
    <p>In addition to erasures, Parker would have the &ldquo;extraneous&rdquo; folios removed from the front of manuscripts which began with the just the end of a text which he was not interested in reconstructing. These pieces of &ldquo;waste&rdquo; would then be used by his binders as pastedowns, endleaves, or limp binding for other books.</p>
    <p>Parker&rsquo;s treatment of his manuscripts is unfortunate in that his practices resulted in unnecessary loss and fragmentation of medieval content, but it might be a sign of just how important a role his library played in the studies of those in his circle:</p>
    <blockquote>He and his associates were, effectively, the sole users of the library, searching through the books for information that bore upon some of the most pressing issues of their own day and using the books as the basis for a major campaign of publication &ndash; the ﬁrst of its kind in England &ndash; that saw Parker bring before the public an important series of editions of British historians as well as the ﬁrst printings of works written in the Old English language. Whereas Cotton would largely be the facilitator of other people&rsquo;s researches, Parker himself played the leading role in and imposed his ﬁrm control over the use of his collection.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></blockquote>
    <p>Parker did not amass manuscripts simply to have or preserve them. His library was a working library, used extensively in his own research and by those close to him in theirs. Some of Parker&rsquo;s less savory habits, like removing &ldquo;extra&rdquo; leaves at the beginning of a manuscript make the collection easier to work with by isolating the texts that needed to be accessed.</p>
    <h3><a name="_Toc481975739"></a>What They Sought</h3>
    <p>According to John Foxe, Archbishop Parker collected books to demonstrate that &ldquo;religion presently &hellip; is no new reformation of things &hellip; but rather a reduction of the Church to the Pristine state of old conformity&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> One of, if not the, most pressing question for reformers in the sixteenth century was &ldquo;where was your church before Luther?&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a> The Roman Catholic church had the benefit of a long history on its side, and the ability to point to tradition as rationale for doctrine. It is natural, then, that Protestants would look to history as well to find evidence to support their proposed changes. For Parker and his circle, that search was conducted in Anglo-Saxon texts. Parker&rsquo;s publications, including our own <em>Testimonie of Antiquitie</em>, were attempts to show how the changes being made to the church were bringing a return to the ways of the English church of yore.</p>
