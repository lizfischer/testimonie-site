<h1>Editorial Policy</h1>
<p>The text presented hereafter was made using the Stanford copy of <em>A Testimonie of Antiquitie </em>as a copy text. It is intended as a diplomatic text: I have attempted to transcribe as faithfully as possible the text as it appears. To that end, I have kept spelling, line breaks, and page divisions the same. I have retained the difference between long (Å¿) and short s. Spacing between words and punctuation proved nearly impossible to determine consistently, and so has all been normalized to the spacing used in modern typesetting (no space before a punctuation mark, a single space after.) Superscripts are used to represent instances where letters appear over other letters (y<sup>t</sup> and y<sup>e</sup>, for example.) All text printed using the Anglo-Saxon typeface as been rendered using the insular character style-set of the font Junicode in order that the visual impact of the original typeface be conveyed in the edition text.</p>
