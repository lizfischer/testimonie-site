    <h2>Subsequent Publications</h2>

    <p>After its initial publication, the <em>Testimonie of Antiquitie</em> was reprinted several times by other people. The earliest of these I have encountered is in a 1623 book published by William L&rsquo;isle titled <em>A</em> <em>Saxon Treatise concerning the Old and New Testament </em>[etc.] along side the titular treatise, a translation of &AElig;lfric&rsquo;s letter to Sigweard.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> A different, smaller Old English typeface than the one commissioned by Parker is used. This book includes at its front a table of Saxon characters and the same Bible verse, Jeremiah 6:16, that was printed on the <em>Testimonie</em> title page (fig. 2). From this page alone, it is clear the appearance of <em>A Saxon Treatise </em>was heavily influenced by Parker&rsquo;s book.</p>
    <p>Just a year later, in 1624, the <em>Testimonie</em> appears again in <em>Three rare monuments of antiquitie </em>[etc.] printed by Edward Raban for David Melvill with two other texts.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> In 1638, L&rsquo;isle&rsquo;s <em>A Ssaxon Treatise</em> was reprinted under the title <em>Divers ancient Monuments in the Saxon Tongue </em>[etc.] by, according to the title page, E. G. for Francis Eglesfield in London.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
    <p>The Modern English text of the <em>Testimonie</em> was reprinted under the same title by Leonard Lichfield at Oxford in 1675 (fig. 3).<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> It includes the same preface, translation, epistle, and letter from the bishops, but omits the prayers. Leonard Lichfield (<em>bap. </em>1637<em>, d. </em>1686) was the son of another Leonard Lichfield (<em>bap. </em>1604<em>, d. </em>1657) who had been official printer to Oxford University. His son, despite claiming the role on the title page of his <em>Testimonie</em> printing, does not seem to have held the position of official printer to the university.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
    <p>In the eighteenth century, the Modern English text was again printed without its Old English counterpart. A 1736 book with the title <em>A Testimony of Antiquity Concerning the Sacramental Body and Blood </em>[etc.] indicates it &ldquo;Printed for the Author&rdquo; but I have found no suggestion of that author&rsquo;s identity. It includes a dedication to &ldquo;the Rev. Dr. Waterland&rdquo;, I presume to be theologian Daniel Waterland,<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> signed &ldquo;Reverend SIR, With all possible Respect, Your very humble Servant.&rdquo; This dedication is followed by an introduction of Parker taken from <em>The Life and Acts of Matthew Parker </em>by John Strype, then the usual contents of the <em>Testimonie</em> (sans Old English pages), followed by &ldquo;Dr. Cave&rsquo;s <em>Account of </em>&AElig;lfric, <em>and the </em>two <em>Epistles</em>&rdquo; and several appendices.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
    <p>The most recent printing of Parker&rsquo;s <em>Testimonie</em> I will mention is from 1877. Again, the Modern English translation alone was printed, this time edited with marginal and foot notes by Walter Arthur Copinger (figs. 4 and 5).<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
