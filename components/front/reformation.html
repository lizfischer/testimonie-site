    <h2> The English Reformation </h2>
    <p>In 1517, Martin Luther posted his Ninety-five Theses opposing the Catholic Church&rsquo;s practice of selling indulgences, famously beginning the Protestant Reformation in Europe. From the ideas for reformation spreading across the Continent sprung the idea for the English Reformation, a split between the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church instigated by King Henry VIII.</p>
    <p>Henry VIII of England succeeded to the throne in 1509. For much of his life, Henry was a devout Catholic; in 1521, for example, he wrote a treatise titled &ldquo;The Defence of the Seven Sacraments&rdquo; as a response to Luther&rsquo;s theses.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> However, personal circumstance challenged Henry&rsquo;s commitment to Rome. By 1527, Henry and his first wife Catherine of Aragon had four unsuccessful pregnancies, a son who died shortly after birth, and a daughter, Mary. Henry, desiring a male heir, sought to have his marriage to Catherine annulled in order to take a new wife who might provide a son. The annulment had legal grounds, as Catherine had previously been married to Henry&rsquo;s brother Arthur. However, this complication was apparent at the time of their marriage, and Pope Julius II issued a papal bull allowing the two to marry despite it. For this reason, and Catherine&rsquo;s familial ties to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, the pope would not grant an annulment.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
    <p>In a series of acts passed by Parliament between 1532 and 1534, the Church of England broke from Rome and established Henry as the head of the Church of England.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> With issues of marriage no longer falling under control of the pope, Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer declared Henry and Catherine&rsquo;s marriage null and Henry could marry his second wife Anne Boleyn. Shortly after their 1533 marriage, Anne gave birth to daughter Elizabeth. Henry would be married again in 1536 to Jane Seymour who died giving birth to their son Edward.</p>
    <p>At this same time, religious houses fell under heavy scrutiny in England and Wales. Thomas Cromwell, chief minister to King Henry VIII, conducted visitations of monasteries and other ecclesiastical estates to assess the conditions and assets of those houses beginning in 1534. By 1536, the process of dissolving the monasteries had begun. Commonly, the given reason for the dissolution is that the crown was undergoing some financial strain, however Henry&rsquo;s reason was likely also spiritual:</p>
    <blockquote>Henry VIII is too often presented as essentially conservative and his break with Rome &shy;&shy;having simply produced 'Catholicism without the pope&rsquo;... Henry's Catholicism was Catholicism without the pope, without monasteries and without pilgrimages. Henry remained devoutly attached to the mass and continued to believe in the benefits of intercessory prayer: what he had already rejected was devotion to individual saints. And what the commissioners itemized as they dealt with the buildings and property of surrendered monasteries only reinforced the king's convictions. All that suggests that ideology was central and that the dissolution in intention and in consequences was much more than a smash-and-grab raid. The demolition of shrines and the exposure of relics reveal religious rather than material motivation. So do the documents which monks and friars were required to subscribe denouncing their past way of life as false. By 1540 no one could have been in any doubt that Henry VIII, Thomas Cromwell and the commissioners who enforced policy believed both that monasteries implicitly and often openly challenged the king's supremacy over the church and that their practice reflected a dangerously misguided view of how God should be serve.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></blockquote>
    <p>Henry&rsquo;s desire to bring religious practice in England in line with his beliefs ended monasteries in England and Wales, and with them went the monastic libraries. Many books were destroyed, some abandoned. Hundreds were taken into royal libraries, and many more wound up in the hands of private collectors.</p>
    <p>In 1539, Parliament passed the Six Articles to elucidate the distinction between the views of the Anglican church from other Protestant movements. Unlike the Lutherans, King Henry&rsquo;s beliefs as expressed in the Six Articles aligned with the Catholic position on several key issues, including transubstantiation and clerical celibacy.</p>
    <p>Henry VIII died in 1547 and his son Edward VI inherited the throne. Under Edward, iconoclasm destroyed stained glass, shrines, chalices, and crucifixes in churches across England. As the English church distanced further from the Roman church, such images of the saints and Christ were viewed as symptoms of idolatry and popery. The requirement of clerical celibacy was also lifted.</p>
    <p>Archbishop Cranmer finished his <em>Book of Common Prayer</em>, a project which began under Henry, in 1549. The <em>Book of Common Prayer</em> contained a calendar for Psalms, the order for Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer, the Litany, Holy Communion, and other sacraments and ceremonies.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> Three years later, a revised version of the <em>Book of Common Prayer</em> was issued, removing, among other things, references to &lsquo;Mass&rsquo; and &lsquo;altars&rsquo;.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> The 1552 edition also moved away from the doctrine of transubstantiation, changing the words spoken as ministers delivered the eucharist from &ldquo;The body of our Lorde Jesus Christe&hellip; The bloud of our Lorde Jesus Christe...&rdquo; to &ldquo;Take and eat this, in remembraunce that Christ dyed for thee&hellip;.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> That same year, the Six Articles were repealed and replaced with Forty-Two Articles with heavier Protestant leanings.</p>
    <p>Edward VI died in 1553 and was succeeded by Mary I, Henry&rsquo;s daughter by Catherine. Mary was a Catholic, and wished to reconcile England with Rome. During her reign, several hundred Protestants were burned at the stake accused of heresy. Her persecution of Protestants earned her the posthumous nickname &ldquo;Bloody Mary&rdquo;, and a monstrous legacy shaped largely by John Foxe&rsquo;s 1563 <em>Book of Martyrs</em>.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> To secure Catholicism for England going forward, she needed an heir to prevent her half-sister Elizabeth, a Protestant, from taking the throne. To this end she married Phillip II of Spain. Unfortunately for Mary, Pope Julius III, with whom she had a good relationship, died in 1555 and was replaced by Pope Paul IV who was anti-Spain and thus anti-Phillip. With no support from Rome, and dying with no heir in 1558, Mary&rsquo;s attempt to bring England back to the Catholic Church was largely unsuccessful.</p>
    <p>After Mary&rsquo;s death, Henry&rsquo;s second daughter, Elizabeth I, took power. Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign saw the unraveling of the changes made during Mary&rsquo;s reign and further distancing from Catholicism. In 1559, Parliament passed another Act of Supremacy declaring Elizabeth the head of the Church of England as her father was. Act of Uniformity in the same year mandated attendance at Anglican churches for Sunday service, featuring a slightly modified version of the 1552 revision of the <em>Book of Common Prayer</em>.</p>
    <p>In the Convocation of 1563, clerics met to revise the Forty-Two Articles put forth during Edward VI&rsquo;s reign, which were not enforced under Mary. Thirty-nine articles were passed by Convocation, but Elizabeth removed one, &ldquo;Of the Wicked which do not eat the Body of Christ in the use of the Lord's Supper&rdquo;, so as to not offend Lutheran subjects. This article was restored in 1571 after hopes of uniting with the Lutheran churches had dissipated.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> &nbsp;The Thirty-nine Articles stated the official stance of the Church of England on doctrine and practices of Christianity relative to those of Catholicism and other Protestants. Crucially, Article 28 stated:</p>
    <p>Transubstantiation, or the change of the substance of bread and wine into the substance of Christ&rsquo;s body and blood (in the supper of the Lord), cannot be proved by Holy Writ, but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, (overthroweth the nature of a sacrament), and hath given occasion to many superstitions&hellip; The body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten, in the supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner; and the mean whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the supper is faith.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
    <p>This meant that the Church of England officially viewed transubstantiation, the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, as false, as it was not founded in the scriptur&shy;e.</p>
    <p>The end of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign with her death in 1603 is considered the end of the English Reformation. While Catholics certainly still existed in England after the Elizabethan period and controversy and conflict over religious principles still stirred, the end of the Tudors brought an end to the years of doctrinal whiplash that had begun with Henry VIII.</p>
