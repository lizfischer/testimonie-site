    <h2>Reader/Owner Interventions</h2>

    <p>The manuscript cover and the ends of the printed portion show many signs of ownership. In this section I will discuss what I have been able to find out about previous owners or readers from the marks they left behind.</p>
    <p>On the last page, facing the inside back cover, a man called Richard Ballett has written his name twice. On that same page, someone has written five lines of Latin which is only moderately legible&mdash;this same hand appears on the front inside cover. It does not appear to be the same ink as either instance of Ballett&rsquo;s name, and is written in a different script, so it is not certain whether he is responsible. One instance of his name does resemble an alphabet written on the front inside cover, however. As to Ballett&rsquo;s identity, not much has been uncovered. Searches on genealogical sites reveal that there are many Richard Ballett&rsquo;s from various parts of England who were born, married, or died during sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. I have found nothing indicating which Ballett he might have been.</p>
    <p>Another name written on the book has proven more fruitful. On the front outside cover, &ldquo;Broughton Library&rdquo; is written clearly. The back outside cover has among many partial names written by someone probably testing a pen. Near the very top, the most complete of these names reads &ldquo;Roger Jacob Bro&hellip;&rdquo; before fading out, but it might be assumed to be Roger Jacob Broughton. This name led me to Hugh and Richard Broughton, brothers from Oldsbury, Shropshire living in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Hugh Broughton was a theologian and scholar of Hebrew at Cambridge in the 1570s.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Richard Broughton was an original fellow of the Elizabethan Society of Antiquaries,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> a group consisting of the likes of William Camden and Sir Robert Cotton.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> While I have not found a Roger Broughton in the family tree, records are very incomplete and scholarship on the less famous early fellows of the Society of Antiquaries is nearly non-existent. I think it extremely likely that the Roger Broughton who has written his name on this book&rsquo;s cover belongs to the same family and Hugh and Richard, as they themselves were exactly the sort of people one would expect to own a copy.</p>
