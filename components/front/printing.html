    <h2>Typeface and Printing</h2>

    <p>Old English uses several different letters (&thorn;, &eth;, ƿ, etc.), and insular scripts use different letter shapes (r for r, s for s, g for g, etc.) than Modern English. While these can all be represented with the usual letter shapes (th for &eth; and &thorn;, w for ƿ, etc.), those working on Parker&rsquo;s book felt it was necessary to design a new typeface. No doubt this was in part, if not entirely, motivated by the air of authority lent to the text by its close resemblance to &ldquo;real&rdquo; medieval books and the unconscious effect it might have on an unconvinced reader. This new typeface was commissioned by the printer, John Day.</p>
    <p>Day began printing in London in 1546. Even early on, many of the books he printed had to do with the debate over the doctrine of the eucharist in the new church. During the reign of Mary I, Day was arrested and briefly imprisoned.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> &nbsp;As one might expect, Day found renewed success under Elizabeth:</p>
    <blockquote>In 1559 he secured a crucial if ambiguous privilege to print Cunningham's<em> Cosmographical Glass</em> for life, and any other books &lsquo;not repugnant to Holy Scripture or the law&rsquo; and not covered by other patents, for seven years. Day exploited this to establish control of publication of the <em>ABC with Little Catechism</em> (a restoration of his Edwardian privilege), and the period's best-selling book, the English psalter of Sternhold and Hopkins. Even without other prestige projects, such as collected editions of the works of Becon, Latimer, and Tyndale, control of these two staples of English religious life would have made him a rich man.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></blockquote>
    <p>Later, in 1563, Day would publish John Foxe&rsquo;s <em>Book of Martyrs</em>, an enormous volume with fifty woodcut illustrations and a complicated page layout. The great success of this book is what gave Day his reputation as a skilled printer.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
    <p><em>A Testimonie </em>was printed in twice by Day in the same year, the second correcting errata and adding folio numbers to the preface.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> The date of publication is problematic as no date has and has been hotly debated. What can be said for certain is that it was first issued sometime between 20 October 1566 and 26 June 1568, but Erick Kelemen has argued persuasively that it was likely finished in the three-month window between October 1566 and early January 1567.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
