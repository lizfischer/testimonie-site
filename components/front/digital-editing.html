    <h1 id="intro">Digital Scholarly Editing: an incomplete overview</h1>
    <p>With present technology, most books are digitized through high-resolution scanning or, for the more unstable or tightly bound objects, photography. Unfortunately, scanning and photography can only capture two-dimensional images of an object; digital images leave out important information about heft, texture, and smell.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> For those who care about the physicality of books, this type of digitiz&shy;ation leaves much to be desired. Even more fully-featured digital editions do not (and cannot) fully represent a physical object. But, despite their shortcomings, digital editions even in their present state are not <em>less</em> useful than a physical object. They are easier to access, easier to search, and easier to disseminate; there is a trade-off between materiality and accessibility. But these are features that come as a consequence of the digital platform whether or not the editor thinks about or intends them.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The way we think about digital editions is important for editors and, consequently, all those who would consume the editions they create. If a digital object is thought of as simply a representation of the physical, an editor is bound to the limits of what the physical object could show. If the digital is conceived as a composite of the physical and the functionality that is unique to the digital realm, the result is what the physical can show in <em>addition</em> to what the technology allows. Recognizing the digital's shortcomings as well as the areas in which it transcends the abilities of a physical object are both necessary for making best use and sense of a digital project. In this chapter, I will take the first step toward this end and examine the state of digital editing by addressing two questions:&nbsp; what are digital scholarly editions, and how do we make them?</p>
    <h4>What are Digital Scholarly Editions?</h4>
    <p>Before we understand what a digital scholarly edition is, we must first understand what the unqualified scholarly edition is. Patrick Sahle<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> offers the definition of a scholarly edition as: &ldquo;the critical representation of historic documents&rdquo; This is a definition falls just short, but as it is the one through which I have come to my own, I wish to examine it closely. Sahle expands on this definition by examining each of its four key terms, two of which I will address: critical and representation.</p>
    <p>Sahle is explicit about using <em>critical</em> to mean more than just textual criticism. He takes the word to be &ldquo;a container for all those activities that apply scholarly knowledge and reasoning to the process of reproducing documents and transforming a document or text into an edition&rdquo;.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> Putting aside the recursion inherent in defining an aspect of a scholarly edition with the word edition, the conceptualization of criticism as an application of scholarly knowledge and reasoning has the benefit of encompassing all varieties of scholarly knowledge and methodologies and makes sense for the interdisciplinary field of scholarly editing.</p>
    <p>Representations, according to Sahle, &ldquo;try to capture objects in their entirety&rdquo;.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> Editions, being critical representations, give a complete representation of their subjects.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> Implicit in these statements is some conception of what constitutes the whole text&mdash;to evaluate the extent to which a subject is captured in its entirety there must be an agreed upon definition of what constitutes the &ldquo;entire&rdquo; text, a consensus which does not exist. There are representations of medieval manuscripts which do not capture the heft and size of the book, and representations of poems which do not preserve the original visual layout<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>, but we still call these editions. That editions fully capture their subjects is at best an idealistic and optimistic claim, and at worst reflective of a sadly narrow view of what has significance in a textual object.</p>
    <p>Defining scholarly editions as &ldquo;critical representations&rdquo; in the manner Sahle does emphasizes the method of creation over the thing itself, and mischaracterizes the relationship between edition and subject. <em>Critical</em> as understood above says more about actions than things&mdash;a representation is critical if it is the product of criticism, of applying scholarly knowledge and reasoning to something; the scholarly aspect of a &ldquo;scholarly edition&rdquo; is derived from it having been produced in a scholarly manner rather than its potential use. For clarity on the word r<em>epresentation</em>, let us turn briefly to dictionary definitions. The Oxford English Dictionary lists as the first definition &ldquo;Something which stands for or denotes another symbolically; an image, a symbol, a sign.&rdquo; This is a fine sense of the word to apply to editions as it makes a purely symbolic link between the representation and the represented, suggesting a hierarchy of authority in which the represented is clearly higher. However, the word also holds another meaning in which representations have &ldquo;the right or authority to speak or act on behalf of [that which is represented].&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> Because the word <em>representation</em> carries this other connotation, of being able to speak for the represented, I am wary of applying it to editions. The idea that an edition ought to and ever could fully speak on behalf of its subject, while appealing, makes it too easy to ignore what is missing.</p>
    <p>In response to both concerns, I define scholarly editions as &ldquo;re-presentations of historical objects which are possessed of features useful to a scholar.&rdquo; Re-presentation is a bit of a clunky term, but it differs from representation in a vital way. Rather standing in for the subject, a re-presentation acknowledges that it is something new, and iteration, second (or third, or fourth) way of viewing the subject. Taking <em>scholarly</em> to denote potential use to a scholar shifts focus from the process of creating an edition to the thing that was created and will be used or read. It is probably true that most re-presentations which have features making them of use to scholars will have been created with scholarly methods and knowledge; still, the distinction is useful to the extent that it shifts our focus to the nature of the edition as an object.</p>
    <h4>Adding &ldquo;Digital&rdquo;</h4>
    <p>With a solid understanding of what a scholarly edition is, we can explore the implications of prefixing with the word <em>digital</em>. There are two large categories into which all digital editions can be placed: those which could reasonably appear in print and those which could not. The former includes editions which were originally published in print and have since been brought into a digital format, and those which were created initially in for a digital medium but could easily be printed without losing content or major components of their functionality. The later includes all editions which could not be printed without loss of content and/or function.</p>
    <p>Patrick Sahle calls the former <em>digitized editions</em>, and insists that a digitized edition should not be considered a digital edition. I do not wish to be so strict. Editions which exist digitally, whether or not they did initially, have in common a set of limitations and features by virtue of them being hosted digitally. To exclude digitized editions from the category of <em>digital editions</em> is to minimize the fact of their being digital objects. A digitized edition must be considered a digital edition because the digital medium heavily influences how readers interact with and experience the material. To differentiate editions which can only exist digitally, I favor the term &ldquo;natively digital edition.&rdquo; This does not deny the influence of the medium on any edition which exists digitally, and is more intuitive than using a specialized definition of digital.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Broadly speaking, most extant digital editions fall into one of five categories: digital facsimile, critical text editions, parallel or fluid text editions, hypertext editions, and what I call second-generation digital editions.</p>
    <p>Digital facsimiles are much like those found in print&mdash;images of pages/folios are presented in sequence&mdash;but digital facsimiles normally provide the ability to zoom and pan<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>. These could be considered natively digital editions because of the added functionality, though whether the loss of that constitutes a <em>significant</em> loss of functionality remains open for discussion. Digital critical text editions are not usually so different from print critical editions (they aim to establish a definitive text). Often digital critical editions differ from their print cousins in that they provide the reader with more extensive information on how the definitive text was decided upon, and note where pieces have been taken from sources other than the base text<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>. Parallel- or fluid-text editions present two or more versions of the text side by side, allowing the reader to see the differences between them first-hand<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>. Editions of these three types can conceivably be native or non-native, dependent on how the creators execute the form.</p>
    <p>Hypertext editions and second-generation digital editions, however, are necessarily native editions. Hypertext editions take advantage of the ability to include hyperlinks in the text by embedding notes on the text, links to external sources, references to other parts of the same text, or any number of other things the editor wants to include that can be referenced with a basic hyperlink<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>. Because hyperlink editions depend entirely on the digital environment to function, they must be natively digital editions&mdash;printing them would result in a significant loss of content and function. &ldquo;Second-generation editions&rdquo; is my term for the kinds of natively digital editions that are starting to emerge which are fundamentally different from any of the other types. Many of these are experimental projects, the sort that are pushing the boundaries of what has been previously done with the digital medium and using the technology in novel ways. Even hypertext editions often follow a format essentially the same as print editions, using the digital environment primarily to increase the amount of information that can be included and the ease of accessing that information, using links instead of foot or endnotes. Second-generation editions do something completely different from what can be done in print. Because of their newness and uniqueness, it is difficult to describe a &ldquo;typical&rdquo; second-generation edition<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>.&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>How do we make them?</h4>
    <p>When it comes to digital work, consistency is king. Any number of mistakes can be undone programmatically in a minute so long as those mistakes were made consistently. Say a transcribed text uses the long-s character (ſ) but the preferred output would only use the short-s character. Because the symbol representing long s is consistent, a simple find and replace can change every instance of &lsquo;ſ&rsquo; to &lsquo;s&rsquo;. Consistency also allows for the development of tools to view and manipulate data. When good standards exist, collaboration is easy.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Unfortunately, there are few standards in digital scholarly editing at present, and the ones that do exist are not without their problems. The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) is a standard for marking up texts in XML. XML uses angle-bracketed tag pairs like &lt;title&gt; &lt;/title&gt; to describe the structure of documents. Tags are nested inside one another, turning the marked up text into a tree of tags. TEI gives a set of rules for what tags to use. As a short example of what TEI encoded text looks like, consider the following hypothetical page:</p>
    <table>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td width="295">
                <p><strong>My Paper</strong></p>
                <p><em>Winnie-the-Pooh</em>, by A. A. Milne is a <em>classic</em> children&rsquo;s book.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p><br /> This text after being marked up would look something like this:</p>
    <p>&lt;TEI xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;text&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;body&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;head&gt;My Paper&lt;/head&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;p&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;title&gt;Winnie-the-Pooh&lt;/title&gt;,</p>
    <p>by</p>
    <p>&lt;name&gt;A.A. Milne&lt;/name&gt;</p>
    <p>is a</p>
    <p>&lt;emph&gt;classic&lt;/emph&gt;</p>
    <p>children&rsquo;s book.</p>
    <p>&lt;/p&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;/body&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;/text&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;/TEI&gt;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The XML tags describe the kind of content that each piece is: <em>Winnie the Pooh</em> is a title, A.A. Milne is a name, <em>classic</em> is emphasized. Later this information can be used to present the text in a certain way (like recreating the original styling by making all headings bold and all emphasized words and titles italicized), or extract all text of a certain type (retrieving all the names from a text, for example), or make claims about structural patterns in the text.</p>
    <p>For texts like this example which can be neatly fit into a tree structure, this is a practicable system of markup, but texts &ldquo;in the wild&rdquo; are much more complicated. A major downside of using an XML-based markup system is there is no neat way to handle <em>something <u>like</u></em><u> this</u>, where two (or more) textual features overlap. The instinct is to mark overlapping regions by overlapping the tags: &lt;emph&gt; something &lt;underline&gt; like &lt;/emph&gt; this &lt;/underline&gt;. But this is not valid XML&mdash;the tags must be nested without overlap. The workaround is to duplicate one of the tags, like so:</p>
    <p>&lt;emph&gt; something &lt;underline&gt; like &lt;/underline&gt; &lt;/emph&gt;<br /> &lt;underline&gt; this &lt;/underline&gt;</p>
    <p>What the above markup says about the text is that &ldquo;something like&rdquo; is an emphasized section, and within that section, &ldquo;like&rdquo; is its own sub-section which is underlined. Following the emphasized section is a separate section, &ldquo;this&rdquo;, which is underlined. This is not only an unnatural and clunky way of describing the text, but it misrepresents the text by imposing an artificial hierarchy and imposing somewhat arbitrary divisions on the text. The rules of XML constrain how we can describe structure, and forces editors to compromise faithfulness to the text for compliance to the standard.</p>
    <p>The second major problem with TEI is not a constraint, but a lack of constraints. In attempting to accommodate the needs of different scholars, there are a plethora of tags in the TEI vocabulary. So many, in fact, that it is hardly a gross exaggeration to say no two projects use the same tags in the same way. Understanding why consistency is the guiding principle when working under a digital paradigm, it is obvious that the lack of consistency in the use even something which claims to be a standard is a problem. The flexibility of TEI makes it difficult to design and building tools to aid in the production of TEI-compliant documents and their subsequent display. There is too little standardization in the standard.</p>
    <p>Despite its problems, TEI is the most widely used system for textual encoding at this moment in digital scholarly editing. It is not a perfect standard, but it is the one we have. Other systems have been proposed, but none yet fully accepted by editors. One particularly promising alternative to strict TEI in XML is standoff markup, pioneered by a group of linguists for marking transcribed speech. With standoff markup, the description of the text is stored separate from the text itself, and regions are demarcated using the position in the file of the first and last character of the region. This solves the overlap problem present in tree-based systems like XML. However, the process of marking up a text in Standoff is tedious, and there are no quality tools to lessen the burden.</p>
    <p>This is by no means a comprehensive explication of the problems in the creation of editions and the standards that exist, but the TEI issue is an important one. New, better standards are being developed, but they will not be widely adopted until sufficiently sophisticated tools exist, and better tools will not be developed unless there is a demand for them by people using the standard.</p>
    <p>In sum, digital scholarly editions are not simply transformations of their print counterparts to a digital medium. The key to realizing their potential is intentionally conceptualizing the digital edition as its own unique <em>thing</em>. For a digital effort to focus on approximating or recreating the physical is to deny what the digital brings to the table as a medium, treating it as an extension of a physical object rather than something new and distinct. A digital edition will never fully represent the physical because it is not the physical; the physical object is an integral part of the digital edition, but it is not the whole of the digital. In some ways, the digital cannot achieve what the physical can; in others, the digital can achieve what the physical cannot. We have been focused on the former, when to move the field forward we must put thought into the latter. This is the goal of the second-generation, natively digital edition.</p>
