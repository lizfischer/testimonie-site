    <h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
	
    <p>From the earliest writing systems developed in the fourth millennium BCE, the invention of the printing press in west in the fifteenth century, to the Kindle in the twenty-first century, textual production and transmission has long been an important part of societies. The book, especially, has shaped our culture. The history of the book as an academic field is relatively new, coming to prominence in the last few decades. Summarizing what it is book historians do is a challenge—it is an extraordinarily interdisciplinary field. Robert Darnton put it well when he wrote, “Books refuse to be contained within the confines of a single discipline when treated as objects of study. Neither history nor literature nor economics nor sociology nor bibliography can do justice to all the aspects of the life of a book.”  Book history is interested in manuscript, printing, authorship, publishing, libraries, literary criticism, reading habits and all else to do with the way books and other textual media exist in the world. A particular interest has arisen in recent years in the book as a physical object, its materiality, perhaps in response to the spread of digital text technologies.</p>

    <p>The subject of this edition is an early printed book entitled <i>A Testimonie of Antiquitie, shewing the auncient faith in the Church of England touching the sacrament of the body and bloude of the Lord here publikely preached, and also receaued in the Saxons tyme, aboue 600 years agoe</i>, published in London in 1566 or 1567. The text is a sermon given by Ælfric of Eynsham (c. 960-1010), a theologian, monk, and abbot, and the most prolific late Anglo-Saxon writer. It is accompanied by a translation from Old English to Early Modern English undertaken by Matthew Parker, the sixteenth-century Archbishop of Canterbury whose foundational role in the English Reformation is of utmost importance. <i>A Testimonie</i> is thought to be the first appearance of Old English in print, and is the first book printed using an Anglo-Saxon typeface. Its contribution to text-technological transformation and ecclesiastical history is noteworthy, indeed.</p>

    <p>Stanford University Library’s Special Collections holds an exceptional copy of <i>A Testimonie</i>; the book is bound in leaves from a unique twelfth-century manuscript, on which is written a portion of chapter four of the Acts of the Apostles. Based on the date and look of the manuscript leaves, it is very possible that they come from a manuscript of Parker's own collection. It is a remarkable multidisciplinary and multimedia object which has never been studied before. This copy of the <i>A Testimonie</i> is the focus of this edition.</p>
	
	<p>In this thesis, I aim to demonstrate by example some of the possibilities inherent in the digital medium that can be shown to benefit the manipulation and interpretation of complex textual objects, while remaining cognizant of that which is lost in digital editioning. The Stanford copy of <i>A Testimonie</i> is the perfect object to use for this investigation—it itself is an edition of Ælfric’s sermon, its multimedia construction provides unique attributes of the object to either be lost or enhanced in a digital edition. The online version of this edition is an amalgamation of three different text technologies of different eras: a print book, bound in a medieval manuscript, “bound” in a digital environment.
