    <h2>A Testimonie of Antiquitie</h2>

    <p>My research Parker&rsquo;s <em>A Testimonie of Antiquitie</em> began with a trip to the United Kingdom to visit libraries in London, Cambridge, and Oxford. There, I was able to see many other copies of the first edition of the <em>Testimonie,</em> as well as subsequent printings and manuscripts thought to be the sources used by Parker and his people in their preparation and translation of <em>A Testimonie</em>. My main interest on this trip was finding out if other copies of <em>A Testimonie</em> are bound in manuscript fragments. I was expecting to find at least a few with such bindings, as using manuscript fragments as covers was not uncommon, and something Parker is especially known for. I hoped that Stanford&rsquo;s copy of the book<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> might have been Parker&rsquo;s own, given its binding. Neither of these were found to be the case. Of all the copies of the book I say, none were bound with manuscript fragments except for the book at Stanford. In this section, I will discuss the contents of the <em>Testimonie</em> generally, and the uniqueness of the Stanford book stemming from its exceptional combination of materials.</p>
    <h3><a name="_Toc481975741"></a>Contents</h3>
    <p>The <em>Testimonie </em>in its first edition has several distinct parts. The title page gives the full title, <em>A Testimonie of Antiquitie, shewing the auncient faith in the Church of England touching the sacrament of the body and bloude of the Lord here publikely preached, and also receaued in the Saxons tyme, aboue 600 years agoe</em>, and a Bible passage, Jeremiah 6:16: &ldquo;Goe into the streetes, and inquire for the olde way: and if it be the good and right way, then goe therein, that ye maye finde rest for your soules. But they say: we will not walke therein.&rdquo; This passage sets the tone for the rest of the book, bidding the reader study the past to look guidance. The main text beings with a preface, followed by the translation of &AElig;lfric, a letter written by &AElig;lfric to Wulfstan in Latin, and a letter signed by fifteen bishops asserting the accuracy of the translation. Finally, the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, Creed, and Ten Commandments are all presented in both Old English and Modern English, followed by a list of special Old English characters used in the text. Each of these parts I will discuss in turn.</p>
    <p>The &ldquo;preface to the Christian reader&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> was written not by Archbishop Parker, but by his Latin secretary John Joscelyn<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>, an accomplished scholar of Old English and Hebrew. Joscelyn studied at Queen&rsquo;s College Cambridge from 1545 to 1549 and joined Parker&rsquo;s household in 1559. Joscelyn, among other things, produced an Old English grammar and wrote all seventy lives of the archbishops (and more) for <em>De antiquitate Britannic&aelig; ecclesi&aelig;<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><strong>[4]</strong></a></em> which was published in 1572.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> In the preface, Joscelyn introduces the work to follow as &ldquo;a testimony of very ancient time, wherein is plainly showed what was the judgement of the learned men in this matter [transubstantiation] in the days of the Saxons before the conquest,&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> gives a short biography of &AElig;lfric, and introduces both the homily and the letter to Wulfstan.</p>
    <p>The homily itself is &AElig;lfric&rsquo;s homily for Easter from his second series of homilies.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> It is presented both in Old English, on the left of each opening, and Modern English translation, on the right. Much of the translation work was, again, done by Joscelyn and less by Parker himself. There are several manuscripts possibly used for the creation this text. I know of four books which passed through Parker or Joscelyn&rsquo;s hands at some point contain the homily <em>In die Sancto pasce</em>: Corpus Christi College, Cambridge MS 302; CCCC MS 198; Cambridge, University Library MS Ii. 4. 6; and British Library, Cotton Faustina A. ix. I&rsquo;ve found no information to suggest that CCCC 302 was used in the production of <em>A </em>Testimonie, while it is certain that CCCC 198 was. The later shows signs of use by Joscelyn and distinctive markings made by the printer, John Day, also found in the British Library manuscript.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> A partial transcription of BL Cotton Faustina A. ix can be found in Appendix A for the reader interested in comparing this manuscript&rsquo;s text with Parker&rsquo;s edition. CUL Ii. 4. 6 was almost certainly not used as reference for the <em>Testimonie</em>, as a note on folio 308v indicates it was given to Parker by the Earl of Bedford on 29 December 1567 &lsquo;in camera stellata&rsquo;, <a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> after <em>A Testimonie</em> was likely published.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> This manuscript is worth spending a moment on, however. The homily begins approximately halfway through the volume, on folio 156, and is marked by a bit of green ribbon glued around the fore edge. Additionally, a sheet of the printed <em>Testimonie</em> text containing the first page of the homily in Old English has been inserted in the open where the homily begins in the manuscript (fig. 1). It is not taken from a complete copy, but appears to be a proof from the printing process. The paper is printed on only one side, with four pages on that side, as they would be before the paper was folded and cut to make the finished book.</p>
    <p>The text of &AElig;lfric&rsquo;s second letter to Wulfstan is likely taken from CCCC MS 190, though other books containing the epistle were seen by Joscelyn. In that manuscript, the letter is found in both Latin and Old English, and Joscelyn has made notes cross referencing the two.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> In <em>A Testimonie</em>, it is only printed in Latin. The contents of the letter deal with the rituals of the sacraments.</p>
    <p>The letter signed with the names of bishops asserts that the undersigned &ldquo;upon diligent perusing, &amp; comparing&rdquo; of the Old English and translation have found that the translation is &ldquo;truly put forth in Print without any adding, or withdrawing any thing for the more faithful reporting of the same, and therefore for the better credit.&rdquo; The names of fifteen bishops are then given: Matthew, Archbishop of Canterbury; Thomas, Archbishop of Yorke; Edmund, Bishop of London; James, Bishop of Durham; Robert, Bishop of Winchester; William, Bishop of Chichester; John, Bishop of Hereford; Richard, Bishop of Ely; Edwin, Bishop of Worcester; Nicholas, Bishop of Lincoln; Richard, Bishop of S. David&rsquo;s; Thomas, Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield; John, Bishop of Norwhich; John Bishop of Carlisle; and Nicholas, Bishop of Bangor. Since very few people read Old English, this letter was intended to reassure those skeptical of the honesty of Parker and Joscelyn&rsquo;s presentation of the material and lacking the skill to verify for themselves.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
    <p>Finally, the book concludes with a table of the special Anglo-Saxon characters used in the text. The characters listed are d, &eth;, &thorn;, f, g, i, r, s, t, ƿ, y, z, two forms of &AElig;, &ETH;, &THORN;, E, H, M, S, Ƿ, ⁊ and ꝥ. This kind of table became a fixture in future printed books containing Old English, but in the front matter rather than at the end.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
